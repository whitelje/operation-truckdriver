This application was created as a final project for CSSE 483: Android Application Development at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. 

It connects to a vehicle network adapter to stream data from a J1939 compliant vehicle. This data is joined with GPS data to create a electronic log. These logs are stored to Firebase for review in the application.
